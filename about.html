        <p>A communicative person with excellent work habits who likes to work in teams. Very motivated with solid understanding HTML, CSS and JS.
           I find programming very interesting ,challenging and exciting. It is one of the ways where I can show my creativity.
           I love to learn and in programming you constantly need to learn new things and keep going every day.
           That is why in 2019 I started to self-learning front end web development. My dream is to start a new career in web development.
           I'm ready for hard work and learning every day to improve my skills and upgrade my knowledge.
           At this time I have several projects behind me. In leisure time I like to play sports and do web programming.</p>
